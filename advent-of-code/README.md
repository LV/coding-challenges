# Advent of Code

## Running a Solution
You can use the `make run` target to execute a solution. For example:
```
make run YEAR=2015 DAY=01
```

## Generating a solution template
Say you want to begin solving 2015 day 2. You can use the following Python script to generate a source file template for you:
```
python3 generate_solution_template.py 2015 2
```
